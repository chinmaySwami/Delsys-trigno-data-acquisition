This code is an extension to an already existing repository on github. Following is the link to the repository:
https://github.com/axopy/pytrigno

Using pytrigno I am reading in IMU data from Delsys Trigno Avanti sensors and am plotting them in realtime and saving the acquired data into a CSV file.
The code consists of two files.

Files and description: 
acquire_data.py : This program reads the data steam from the delsys trigno control utility and once keyboard interrupt is invoked, saves the acquired data into a csv file.
